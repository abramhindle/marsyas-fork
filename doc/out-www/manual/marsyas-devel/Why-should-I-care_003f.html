<h4 class="subsection">2.2.5 Why should I care?</h4>

<h5 class="unnumberedsubsubsec">Developers</h5>

<p>Think of these tests as a mutual assistance pact: you should care
about not breaking other people's code, because other people will
care about not breaking <em>your</em> code.

   <p>Of course, this requires that you create black-box tests for your
own code.  Due to practicality, we can't check every single case
of every single program.  So instead, create one or two tests
which investigate as many things as possible.  For example,
instead of simply testing if sfplay can output a sound file, we
test changing the gain, starting at a specific time, and only
playing for a specific length.

   <p>We recommend discussing potential black-box tests on the
developer mailist.

<h5 class="unnumberedsubsubsec">New users</h5>

<p>These tests are also very useful if you start investigating a new
aspect of Marsyas.  Currently there are many unmaintained
MarSystems, applications, and projects in Marsyas.  New users can
easily waste hours trying to use part of the codebase which has
been broken for months.

   <p>Having a testing mechanism means that users know that the code is
working &ndash; at least, working for the exact command and input that
the test uses.  If (when?) a user has problems getting something
to work in Marsyas, he can turn to the regtests: if a regtest
passes but his own code doesn't work, he can compare his code
against the regtest code.

   <p>Trust me, by now I've probably spent 20 hours trying to make
broken code to work &ndash; sometimes when the developers already knew
it was broken!  Quite apart from the waste of time, it's
incredibly demoralizing.  It was this problem that inspired me to
create these tests.

<p><b>MARSYAS</b> (<b>M</b>usic <b>A</b>nalysis <b>R</b>etrieval and <b>S</b>ynthesis for
<b>A</b>udio <b>S</b>ignals) is a free software framework for audio analysis,
synthesis and retrieval written by George Tzanetakis and community of
developers from around the world. It has been in development for over 10
years and has been used for a variety of projects in academia and
industry. More information about such projects as well as a list of
publications related to Marsyas can be found at the <b>Marsyas</b> website
<a href="http://marsyas.info/">http://marsyas.info/</a>. Please direct any questions/comments
about Marsyas to (gtzan@cs.uvic.ca). <a name="index-Tzanetakis_002c-George-1"></a>
The major underlying theme under the design of Marsyas has been to
provide an efficient and extensible framework for building audio
analysis (and synthesis) applications with specific emphasis on Music
Information Retrieval (MIR). A variety of building blocks for
performing common audio tasks are provided. Some representative
examples are: soundfile IO, audio IO, signal processing, and machine
learning modules.  These blocks can be composed into data flow
networks that can be modified and controlled dynamically while they
process data in soft real-time.

   <p>Another goal has been to accomodate two different types of users:
naive and expert (of course in many cases the same person can operate
in both modes). Naive users are able to construct networks of
primitive objects and experiment with them through the use of
controls. They can interact with the system through the use of graphical
user interfaces or high level scripts without actually having to
compile any code. Marsyas provides a high-level of control at runtime
without sacrificing performance. Expert users can create new primitive
objects and create more complex applications by writing code and
compiling. These two modes of operation will become clearer in the
following sections of the manual. As with any piece of software the
holy grail is to provide maximum automatic support for the tasks that
can be automated while retaining expressiveness and the ability to
program complex systems for the particular domain of interest.

   <p>This framework has been created mainly to support the research of the
developers in the emerging area of Music Information Retrieval
(MIR). Anyone who finds the framework useful is welcome to use it and
contribute to it.

   <p>There is a lot of work behind the development of Marsyas. Although
Marsyas is and will remain free software, any form of financial or
hardware support is more than welcome.  The sourceforge page contains a
link for people to donate money to the project and any contribution is
welcome and will help further improve the framework. Also implementation
of specific features can be motivated by donation. Finally for companies
desiring to incorporate Marsyas into closed source software products a
commercial license is also available (this dual licensing scheme is
similar to the one used by Trolltech the company behind the Qt toolkit). 
For more information about the dual licensing contact George
Tzanetakis.

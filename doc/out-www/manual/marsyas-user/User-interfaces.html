<h4 class="subsection">3.0.2 User interfaces</h4>

<p>A variety of graphical user interfaces are provided with the Marsyas
source distribution. Although it is possible to write a user interface
that communicates with Marsyas in any language there is specific support
for interfacing with the Qt toolkit by Trolltech
<a href="http://www.qtsoftware.com/products/">http://www.qtsoftware.com/products/</a>. In order to compile the
graphical user interfaces you will need to have Qt4 installed and
enable the WITH_QT using CMake. More information can be found at
the chapter <a href="Source-installation.html#Source-installation">Source installation</a>.

   <p>MarPlayer is a simple audio player that provides a seekable playback
progress indicator while playing audio and showcases multi-threading
using Qt4 and Marsyas.

<pre class="example">     cd MY_MARSYAS_DIR/build/bin
     MarPlayer
</pre>
   <p>This will launch the MarPlayer GUI. Click on File and open one of the
audio files in the collections (or any file in a Marsyas supported
format). Clicking on the playback slider will seek to the corresponding
location in the audio file.

<pre class="example">     cd MY_MARSYAS_DIR/build/bin
     MarPhasevocoder
</pre>
   <p>Open a file and experiment with the sliders. The Frequency and Time
sliders can be used to pitch shift the recording without changing the
duration or speed up or slow down the recording without changing the
pitch respectively. The Sinusoids slider can be used to control
the number of sinusoids (sorted by amplitude) that are used to
approximate the audio signal at each frame. This example showcases
user interaction with a relatively performance intensive audio synthesis
technique like the phasevocoder which frequently does not have real-time
implementations.

   <p>The last example of a user interface is a content-based music browsing
interface for large audio collections based on self-organizing
maps. First you will need to create the genres10.mf collection file
as described in Section <a href="Command_002dline-tools.html#Command_002dline-tools">Command-line tools</a>.

<pre class="example">     cd MY_MARSYAS_DIR
     MarGrid2
</pre>
   <p>Click on File-Open-Open Collection File and select the genres10.mf
collection. Then click on the E button (Extract) which performs
feature extraction for all the 1000 files in the collection. This will
take a few minutes and you can view the progress in the terminal output. 
When the feature extraction is complete click on the T button (Train)
which trains a self-organizing map that maps the high-dimenstional
continuous audio features representing each song to 2D coordinates
on a grid. This takes a few seconds. Now click on the P (Predict) button
to place each song on the grid. Feature extraction is performed again
therefore this takes about the same time as the Train stage. Click
on View-Colour-Mapping mode to see a visualization of the genre
distributions over the self-organizing map. Note that the genre
information is only used for display purposes but not during the
calculation of the mapping. If either the audio features or
the self-organizing map did not work the colors would essentially
appear randomly distributed. Each square contains one more more
tracks that are similar to each other based on the audio feautures. 
Clicking on a squares allows the user to cycle through the songs. 
Another interesting feature can be activated by selecting
View-Continuous which switches songs continuously as the user
hovers over the space without requiring explicit clicking. This
mode is particularly effective when using touch surface interaction. 
Once a mapping is calculated it is possible to save the grid and
load it without requiring the time consuming stages of feature
extraction and training.

<h4 class="subsection">6.5.1 Scheduling in Marsyas</h4>

<p>Scheduling is the art of delaying actions (events) until later periods in time. 
In Marsyas time and event are are more general than many other systems. This
allows for a wide range of user specified control rates and actions.

<h5 class="subsubsection">6.5.1.1 Time</h5>

<p>Time is simply a counter. What it counts is up to the writer of a new timer
class. The two supplied timers, TmSampleCount and TmRealTime, count audio samples
and system micro-seconds respectively.

   <p>There are a number of issues surrounding control rates in Marsyas and most other
time-aware processing systems. Marsyas' primary task is to process audio data. 
This data passes through the network in buffers of size N. Usually the network
is prompted to process the buffer of N samples by an outer loop. During
processing control of the network is lost as the buffer of data passes through
each MarSystem object. The scheduler checks for and dispatches events when the
network is ticked and before the buffer of data passes through the network. 
Events are therefore dispatched at the start of each buffer processed.

   <p>Event dispatch is therefore governed by the audio sample rate. Ultimately every
custom timer bears some relation to the audio sample rate. Since events are
dispatched at the start of each tick, events are actually dispatched at a rate
of every N samples. This implies that there is a granularity on event dispatch
based on the sample rate and buffer size. If an event is to be dispatched at a
point in time that falls inside a buffer, ie at 256 for a buffer size of 512
samples, then that event will not be dispatched until the next buffer boundary
at which point its dispatch time will be &lt;= current counter time.

   <p>We might wish to have sample accurate event timing. After all, there are other
audio processing systems that can claim the accuracy we might desire. The major
obstacle to achieving this accuracy is due to Marsyas' dataflow architecture. 
When a buffer of N samples passes through the network it is processed multiple
times (normally once by each object in the network). This means that each sample
recurs a number of times equal to the number of Marsystems that process it. 
More specifically, if the time is T when the network is ticked, then after the
first MarSystem processes the buffer of N samples time will be at T+N. The next
MarSystem will start processing the buffer at time T. In this way, time bounces
between T and T+N as the buffer passes through the network. This situation makes
it exceedingly difficult to make the network consistent for events that occur
between T and T+N. If a control value C is to be changed at time T+K where 0&lt;K&lt;N
then for C to remain consistent for all MarSystem objects that might be
interested then it must be changed to the previous state at the start of buffer
processing then to the new value at the event time - each time the buffer is
processed. This would be somewhat difficult and computationally expensive to
accomplish within the dataflow model. For this reason the scheduler only
dispatches events on buffer boundaries - when the network is ticked - as this is
the only point when all MarSystems are at the same point in time.

   <p>In many systems multiple control rates are desireable. Consider two timers based
on separate sample rates such as 44.1kHz and 12.34kHz. Since both of these rates
are regular, that is they repeat at a constant rate, then a simple conversion
function can be used to convert between the two rates. By converting one of the
rates to the other a single timer can be used in the scheduler. However for
other timers an errorless conversion function may not be possible. Consider a
control rate based on detecting someone tapping a drum stick. The rate of
tapping could be described as irregular because it is not known exactly when the
next tap will happen. Combining this timer with the audio sample rate creates
the problem that no perfect conversion function is possible that can compute
what the sample time will be for N taps in the future. In Marsyas this problem
is bypassed through the support of multiple timers. Events are therefore posted
on the timers they are specified on and no timer conversion takes place.

<h5 class="subsubsection">6.5.1.2 Event</h5>

<p>An event is simply something that happens at some point in time. In Marsyas
an event is a class that contains a user-defined function. What this function
contains is up to the writer and can act on the Marsyas network or outside of
it. Marsyas is not threaded and neither is the scheduler so the scheduler will
wait for the event to complete its action before resuming. Be careful not to
do excessive processing during the dispatch of an event.

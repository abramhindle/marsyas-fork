<h4 class="subsection">4.3.2 <code>bextract</code></h4>

<p><a name="index-bextract-12"></a>
<code>bextract</code> <a name="index-bextract-13"></a>is one of the most powerful
executables provided by Marsyas. It can be used for complete feature
extraction and classification experiments with multiple files. It serves
as a canonical example of how audio analysis algorithms can be expressed
in the framework. This documentation refers to the latest refactored
version of bextract. The old-style <code>bextract</code> using the -e
command-line option to specify the feature extractor is still supported
but use of it discouraged.

   <p>Suppose that you want to build a real-time music/speech descriminator
based on a collection of music files named music.mf and a collection
of speech files named speech.mf.  These collections can either be
created manually or using the mkcollection utility. The following
commandline will extract means and variances of timbral features
(time-domain Zero-Crossings, Spectral Centroid, Rolloff, Flux and
Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC) over a texture window of 1 sec.

<pre class="example">     bextract music.mf speech.mf -w ms.arff -p ms.mpl -cl GS
     bextract ms.mf -w ms.arff -p ms.mpl
     bextract -mfcc classical.mf jazz.mf rock.mf -w genre.arff
</pre>
   <p>The first two commands are equivalent assuming that
ms.mf is a labeled collection with the same files
as music.mf and speech.mf. The third-command specifies
that only the MFCC features should be extracted and is
an example of classifying three classes.

   <p>The results are stored in a ms.arff which is a text file storing the
feature values that can be used in the Weka machine learning environment
for experimentation with different classifiers.  After a header
describing the features (attribute in Weka terminology) it consists of
lines of comma separated feature values. Each line corresponds to a
feature vector. The attributes in the generated .arff file have long
descriptive names that show the process used to calculate the attribute. 
In order to associate filenames and the subsequences of feature vectors
corresponding to them each subsequence corresponding to a file is
prefixed by the filename as a comment in the .arff file. It is a text
file that is straighforward to parse. Viewing it in a text editor will
make this clearer.

   <p>In addition to Weka, the native Marsyas kea tool <a href="kea.html#kea">kea</a> can be used
to perform evaluations (cross-validation, accuracies, confusion
matrices) similar to Weka although with more limited functionality.

   <p>At the same time that the features are extracted, a classifier (in the
example above a simple Naive Bayes classifier (or Gaussian)) is trained
and when feature extraction is completed the whole network of feature
extraction and classification is stored and can be used for real-time
audio classification directly as a Marsyas plugin stored in ms.mpl.

   <p>The resulting plugin makes a classification decision every 20ms but
aggregates the results by majority voting (using the Confidence
MarSystem) to display time-stamped output approximately every 1
second. The whole network is stored in ms.mpl which is loaded into
sfplugin and file_to_be_classified is played and classified at the same
time. The screen output shows the classification results and
confidence. The second command shows that the live run-time
classification can be integrated with <code>bextract</code>. In both cases
collections can be used instead of single files.

<pre class="example">     sfplugin -p ms.mpl music_file_to_be_classifed.wav
     sfplugin -p ms.mpl speech_file_to_be_classifed.wav
     bextract -e ms.mf -tc file_to_classified.wav
     bextract -e ms.mf -tc collection_to_classified.wav
</pre>
   <p>Using the command-line option -sv turns on single vector
feature extraction where one feature vector is extracted per file. 
The single-vector feature representation is useful for
many Music Information Retrieval tasks (MIR) such
as genre classification, similarity retrieval, and visualization
of music collections. The following command can
be used to generate a weka file for genre classification with one
vector per file.

<pre class="example">     ./bextract -sv cl.mf ja.mf ro.mf -w genres.arff -p genres.mpl
</pre>
   <p>The resulting genres.arff file has only one feature vector line
for each soundfile in the collections. In this case where
no -cl command-line argument is specified a linear
Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier is used instead.

   <p>Feature sets refer to collections of features that can
be included in the feature extraction. It includes
several individual feature sets proposed in the MIR
and audio analysis literature as well as some common combinations
of them. (for details and the most updated list of supported
sets experienced users can consult the selectFeatureSet() function
in bextract.cpp). The feature sets can be separated into three
lagre groups depending what front-end is used: time-domain,
spectral-domain, lpc-based.

   <p>The following feature sets are supported (for definitions consult
the MIR literature, check the corresponding code implementations
and send us email with question for details you don't understand) :

     <dl>
<dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-timbral --TimbralFeatures</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>      Time ZeroCrossings, Spectral  Centroid, Flux and Rolloff,
and Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC). Equivalent to
-mfcc -zcrs -ctd -rlf -flx. This also the default extracted feature set.

     <br><dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-spfe --SpectralFeatures</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>      Spectral Centroid, Flux and Rolloff. Equivalent to
-zcrs -ctd -rlf -flx.

     <br><dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-mfcc --MelFrequencyCepstralCoefficients</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>      Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients.

     <br><dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-chroma --Chroma</span></samp>&rsquo;<br><dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-ctd --SpectralCentroid</span></samp>&rsquo;<br><dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-rlf -- SpectralCentroid</span></samp>&rsquo;<br><dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-flx --SpectralFlux</span></samp>&rsquo;<br><dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-zcrs --ZeroCrossings</span></samp>&rsquo;<br><dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-sfm --SpectralFlatnessMeasure</span></samp>&rsquo;<br><dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-scf --SpectralCrestFactor</span></samp>&rsquo;<br><dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-lsp --LineSpectralPair</span></samp>&rsquo;<br><dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-lpcc --LinearPredictionCepstralCoefficients</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd></dl>

   <p>By default stereo files are donwmixed to mono by summing the two
channels before extracting features.  However, bextract also supports
the extraction of feature based on stereo information. There are
feature sets that can only be extracted from stereo files. In addition
it is possible to use any of the feature sets described above
and extract features for both left and right channels that are
concatenated to form a feature vector.

     <dl>
<dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-spsf --StereoPanningSpectrumFeatures</span></samp>&rsquo;<br><dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-st --stereo</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>      Calculate whatever feature sets are activated for both left
and right channels. 
</dl>

   <p>For example the first command below calculates MFCC for both
left and right channels.  The second command calculates
the Stereo Panning Spectrum Features which require both
channels and also the Spectral Centroid for both left
and right.

<pre class="example">     bextract -st -mfcc mymusic.mf -w mymusic.arff
     bextract -spsf -st --SpectralCentroid -w mymusic.arff
</pre>
   <p>The feature extraction can be configured in many ways
(only some of which are possible through command-line
options). The following options can be used to control
various aspects of the feature extraction process
(most of the default values assume 22050 Hz sampling rate):

     <dl>
<dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-c --collection</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>      the collection of files to be used
<br><dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-s --start</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>      starting offset (in seconds) into each soundifle from which features will be extracted
<br><dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-l --length</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>      length (in seconds) of each soundfile from which features will be extracted. A length of -1.0 indicates that the entire duration of the file should be used (the default behavior)
<br><dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-n --normalization</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>      apply normalization to audio signal
<br><dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-fe --featExtract</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>      only extract features without training the classifier

<br><dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-as --accSize</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>      size in analysis frames of how many feature vectors are summarized
when single vectors per file are calculated (default 1298 - approximately 30 seconds)
<br><dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-m --memory</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>      size in analysis frames of how many features vectors are summarized
for each texture window (default 40 - approximately 1 second)
<br><dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-cl --classifier</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>      classifier used for training and prediction (default GS - a simple Naive Bayes Classifier)
<br><dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-e --extractor</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>      old-style specification of feature extraction maintained for backward compatibility (usage discouraged)
<br><dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-p --plugin</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>      filename of generated Marsyas plugin (.mpl file)
<br><dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-w --wekafile</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>      filename of generated .arff file (for Weka or kea)
<br><dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-tc --test</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>      filename of collection or soundfile used for prediction
after a model is trained (can be used to conduct MIREX style
experimetns)
<br><dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-pr --predict</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>      filename of a collection or soundfile used for prediction
after a model is trained
<br><dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-wd --workdir</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>      Directory where all generated files will be written by
defautl the current directory is used

   </dl>

<h5 class="subsubheading">TimeLines</h5>

<p>bextract also supports a mode, called the Timeline mode that allows
labeling of different sections of an audio recording with different
labels. For example, you might have a number of audio files of Orca
recordings with sections of voiceover, background noise, and orca calls. 
You could train a classifier to recognize each of these types of signal. 
Instead of a label associated with each file in the collection
there is an associate Marsyas timeline file (the format is described
below). To run bextract in Timeline mode, there are two steps:
training and classifier:

<pre class="example">     bextract -t songs.mf -p out.mpl -pm
     
     Where:
     
     -t songs.mf - A collection file with a song name and its
     corresponding .mtl (Marsyas Timeline) file on each line
     
     -p out.mpl  - The Marsyas Plugin to be generated
     
     -pm         - Mute the output plugin
</pre>
   <p>and predicting labels for a new audio recording

<pre class="example">        sfplugin -p out.mpl songmono.wav
     
     Where:
     
     -p out.mpl   - The plugin output by bextract in step #1
</pre>
   <p>The songs.mf file is Marsyas collection file with the path to song
(usually .wav) files and their corresponding Marsyas Timeline
(.mtl) files on each lines.  Here is an example song.mf file:

<pre class="example">       /path/to/song1.wav \t /path/to/song1.mtl
       /path/to/song2.wav \t /path/to/song2.mtl
       /path/to/song3.wav \t /path/to/song3.mtl
</pre>
   <p>Please note that the separator character \t must be an actual tab, it
cannot be any other kind of whitespace.

   <p>The .mtl format has three header lines, followed by blocks of 4
lines for each annotated section.  The format is:

<pre class="example">       HEADER:
       -------
     
       number of regions
       line size (=1)
       total size (samples)
     
       FOR EACH SAMPLE:
       ----------------
       start (samples)
       classId (mrs_natural)
       end (samples)
       name (mrs_string)
</pre>
   <p>For example:
<pre class="verbatim">  3
  1
  2758127
  0
  0
  800000
  voiceover
  800001
  1
  1277761
  orca
  1277762
  2
  2758127
  background
</pre>

   <p>Because the .mtl file is kind of obtuse, we have written a small
Ruby program to convert Audacity label files to .mtl format.  This
script can be found at marsyas/scripts/generate-mtl.rb.  The
script is currently hardcoded to recognize the chord changes from
songs from the annotated Beatles archive, but you can easily
change this by modifying the "chords_array" variable.
